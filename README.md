Rules

🚏 Routing Guidelines
Ensure seamless navigation between all pages using a consistent routing framework (e.g., React Router or similar).

Routes should never break when users navigate through the app. Each transition must be smooth and error-free 🚀.

Use clear and intuitive paths for routes (e.g., /home, /about, /contact, etc.) to enhance the user experience.

🔗 Link Functionality

All internal and external links must work properly ✅.

Make sure links to other sections or external websites do not result in a 404 page or a broken state 🛑.

Double-check every link before pushing changes to prevent broken links 🧹.

📝 Text & Formatting Standards
Text across all pages should be grammatically correct and formatted for clarity 🖋️.

Use headings, paragraphs, and lists to structure content for easy readability 📑.

Maintain consistency in font styles and sizes to create a uniform and professional appearance across the site 🎨.

⚙️ Page Functionality

Every page must function smoothly without any console errors or runtime crashes ⚠️.

Test each page on a variety of devices and screen sizes to ensure responsive design 📱💻.

Report any bugs or issues in the GitHub Issues section, and ensure they are fixed before deployment 🛠️.

🚀 Deployment Checklist

The application must be deployed and publicly accessible 🌐 through a valid URL.

Deployment should reflect the latest code from the main branch, and be stable with no routing or page errors 🎯.

Before marking the project as complete, thoroughly test the deployment for working links, functional pages, and proper routing ✅🔗.
